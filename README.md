# Emerald-Inventory-System
A customized hardware store inventory system wep app, which I built on pure PHP and mySQL database.

# How it works
This application was built for a freelance client of mine to help automate their business's inventory process. It allows the user
to control inventory maintenance, make iventory transactions and view records in an organized manner.

# Built with
Back end
* PHP 7.0.0

Front end
* Bootstrap 3.0.0

Database
* mySQL

# Usage
Import sql database file located in the 'db/' folder in the root directory to phpMyAdmin. Then change the database connection in the 'production/db/' folder to appropriate configurations.

After installing all dependencies, run the app inside your localhost folder in xampp server.
